"""This is a simplistic Path Detector.

    A Path Detector module is a python file that contains a `detect` function
    that is capable of analyzing a binarized image in which non-zero pixels
    indicate road boundaries. The analysis should identify the path (or,
    multiple paths) to follow.

    See the description of the `detect` function below for more details.

    This Simplistic Path Detector implements a first crude idea to path
    detection, and needs ample modification in order to obtain a working
    prototype.

    In this Simplistic Path Detector, a path is detected by sampling a single
    row towards the bottom of the image. Non-zero pixels are identified to
    infer the road between the car center and the road center is calculated and
    used as the path to follow. """
